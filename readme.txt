This Java project implements an algorithm to search through the accompanying textfile tempest.txt and return the top 10 words by wordcount. The algorithm works by removing all characters not found in words and then splitting the resulting string into a word array. Count information is then obtained for each unique word and a running tally of the top 10 words is performed and printed. The textfile tempest.txt is assumed to be in the project root.
